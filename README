This is a platform-independent text-based xload-like tool. tload is
generally cool enough, but it only appears to come with slackware, and
doesn't trivially port to other operating systems. I also don't like the way
it deals with changing scales of information--each column may use a
different scale.

Building:
There is no "configure", but there is a "build" command. It will do a few
simple environment checks, compile the source and put it in place.

Development notes:
- You'd think that resizing text windows would be easy. At least I did. I
  figured curses would do most of the majik for me. Except for OpenBSD's
  ncurses implementation, that's completely not the case. Turns out there's
  a real common ioctl (TIOCGWINSZ) that does it and it's so well known that
  nobody seems to be interested in mentioning it anywhere. TIOCGWINSZ seems
  to work well under the BSD's, linux, and OSX, and Solaris 10. Reports of
  other successes and failures welcomed.
